# Heart-Rate-Prediction-by-using-Logistic-Regression-model
This Project performs an analysis and prediction of heart rate using the Framingham dataset.

## Conclusion

- We used the **Framingham Heart Study** dataset to predict whether an individual has a **high heart rate (â‰¥ 90 bpm)** based on various health-related features.
- After cleaning and exploring the data, we engineered a binary classification target and trained a **logistic regression model**.
- The model achieved a **reasonable accuracy**, and evaluation metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) indicate that it can be useful for **early identification of elevated heart rate conditions**.
- To further improve model performance, we can:
  - Experiment with **other classifiers** like Random Forest, XGBoost, or SVM.
  - Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV.
  - Apply **feature selection** and handle **class imbalance** more robustly.
- This study demonstrates the potential for using machine learning in **preventive cardiovascular health screening**.
