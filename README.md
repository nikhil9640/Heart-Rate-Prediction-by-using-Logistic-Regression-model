# Heart-Rate-Prediction-by-using-Logistic-Regression-model
This Project performs an analysis and prediction of heart rate using the Framingham dataset.

# Description
This project involves analyzing and predicting heart rate levels using the Framingham Heart Study dataset, a widely used cardiovascular health dataset. The focus is on identifying individuals with elevated heart rate (≥ 90 bpm), which can be an early indicator of cardiovascular risk, stress, or other underlying health issues.

# Objective
To preprocess and explore the Framingham dataset for relevant patterns and features related to heart rate.
To engineer a binary classification target based on heart rate thresholds (high vs. normal).
To build a Logistic Regression model that predicts whether an individual has a high heart rate.
To evaluate the model's performance using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
To derive actionable insights for potential use in preventive cardiovascular screening.

## Conclusion

- We used the **Framingham Heart Study** dataset to predict whether an individual has a **high heart rate (≥ 90 bpm)** based on various health-related features.
- After cleaning and exploring the data, we engineered a binary classification target and trained a **logistic regression model**.
- The model achieved a **reasonable accuracy**, and evaluation metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) indicate that it can be useful for **early identification of elevated heart rate conditions**.
- To further improve model performance, we can:
  - Experiment with **other classifiers** like Random Forest, XGBoost, or SVM.
  - Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV.
  - Apply **feature selection** and handle **class imbalance** more robustly.
- This study demonstrates the potential for using machine learning in **preventive cardiovascular health screening**.
